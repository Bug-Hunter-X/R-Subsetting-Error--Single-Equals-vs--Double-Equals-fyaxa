This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in R programming related to data frame subsetting.  The `bug.R` file contains code that incorrectly uses a single equals sign (`=`) instead of a double equals sign (`==`) when creating a subset of a data frame based on a condition. This leads to unexpected behavior or errors. The `bugSolution.R` file shows the correct way to perform the subsetting operation using the double equals sign for proper comparison. This example highlights the importance of careful attention to detail when working with logical operators in R.
